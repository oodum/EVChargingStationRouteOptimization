## Setup
If you are using a **JetBrains IDE**, you can simply place all the files in the same directory and run the program. If the terminal says `Error: could not load cache`, navigate to `File -> Reload CMake Project`.

Otherwise, create a project in your preferred C++ compiler, run `main.cpp` in that project. The program will error and create a `PUT data.csv HERE.txt` file in the same directory. Locate that file and replace it with the `data.csv` file found inside the `cmake-build-debug` directory of **this repo**.

After that, you're all set!
